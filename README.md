## 🎮 About the Game

This is a classic **Tetris game** implemented using **Python** and **Pygame**. The objective is to rotate and stack falling tetromino blocks to form complete horizontal lines, which then get cleared for points. The game continues until the blocks reach the top of the screen.

It's a fun and nostalgic recreation of the iconic block-dropping arcade game!
